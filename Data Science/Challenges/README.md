Where I complete certain challenges or assignments from friends or teachers.

## The 30 min challenge

The 30 min challenge was a challenge by a friend to see how quickly i could finish their assignment.
The program is the 14-15 Puzzle game, where you have order the tiles from 1 to 15 with only one spare spot to move adjacent tiles to.
